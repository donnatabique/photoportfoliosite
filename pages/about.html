                        Hello there!</p>
                    <p>
                        As a child, you are constantly asked what you want to be when you grow up. My answers ranged from firefighter to musician to Broadway star to any other occupation you can name. But around the eigth grade, I realized that I actually had a passion for photography (or at least that is around the time most of my photos started popping up). This is around the time I had started to bring a camera everywhere I went, and I became known as the "group photographer" to all of my friends. While this meant that I didn't have too many photos of myself, I really didn't mind because I loved capturing memories that will last a lifetime.
                    <br/><br/>
                        Some other facts about me: I am a senior at Arizona State University studying Computer Information Systems and an intern at a technology company. When I'm not doing school or work-related things, I also enjoy playing <a href="http://instagram.com/donnatabiquemusic" target="_blank"><b>music</b></a> (particularly guitar and piano) and traveling to new places. Tacos are my favorite food, and I like to spend a lot of my time in coffee shops.
                    <br/><br/>
                        But enough about myself, let's talk about you. (Because I like you, of course.) And because I like you, I'd love to be able to capture the moments that are important to you. Let's snap those photos for that new Facebook profile picture, for those graduation cards you want to send out to all of your friends and family, or for that new LinkedIn profile headshot to show off those brand new fancy-schmancy business clothes you just bought. Or if you just want to enjoy the pictures that I've taken at places I've been, you can have those too. I'm really cool with either. If you're interested in working with me, please head over to the <a href="contact.html"><b>contact page</b></a> and send me an email to book a time. <br/><br>
